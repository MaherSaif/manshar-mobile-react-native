# Manshar — iOS Application

A mobile client built with [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

## The Idea

Reac Native is a new open source project built by Facebook. It lets you build Javascript application that will be compiled to a native one.

> React Native enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and React.

Since we all know Javascript, React Native would be the solution to start building a mobile (iOS) client for Manshar.

## Development

Since we are developing for iOS we recommend to have OSX to start with. You should have `Xcode`, [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and Node.

* Install watchman `brew install --HEAD watchman`
* Install the cli of React Native `npm install -g react-native-cli`
* Clone the project
* Open Manshar.xcodeproj in your Xcode
* Also, open the project in you favorite editor

## Current Status

Currently, we are learning React Native and [ES6 (ECMAScript 6)](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6/), so expect to have zillions of changes (project flow and/or code structure).

We :heart: learning: open issues, suggeest things, teach us.
